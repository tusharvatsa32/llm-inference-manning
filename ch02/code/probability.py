# # Probability Fundamentals for Language Models
#
# This notebook explores the fundamental probability concepts that underlie language models and text generation. We'll cover key mathematical concepts and their PyTorch implementations, building intuition for how sampling strategies work in practice.
#
# ## Learning Objectives
# - Understand joint and conditional probabilities and their role in language modeling
# - Work with latent variables and marginalization

# - Use sampling-based approximation methods
# - Apply maximum likelihood estimation from samples
# - Visualize probability concepts with interactive examples

# %% [markdown]
# ## Setting Up Our Environment

# ## 1. Conditional Probability: The Foundation of Language Models
#
# Language models are fundamentally based on conditional probability. Given a sequence of words, we want to predict the next word. Mathematically, this is:
#
# $$P(w_{t+1} | w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_t)$$
#
# The key relationship is: $$P(y|x) = \frac{P(x,y)}{P(x)}$$
#
# Let's set up a bigram language model and visualize its conditional probabilities.

# ## 2. Sampling from Language Models
#
# Now that we have our conditional probabilities, let's see how we can use them to generate text sequences. This demonstrates the core sampling process used in language model text generation.
#
# The sampling process follows this pattern:
# 1. Start with a beginning token
# 2. Use conditional probabilities to sample the next word
# 3. Update the current context and repeat
# 4. Continue until we reach an end token or maximum length

# ## 3. Sampling-Based Estimation: Using Sampling to Estimate Unknown Quantities
#
# **Key Principle**: Sampling is a powerful method for estimating unknown quantities when we have access to related known distributions.
#
# In our case:
# - **Known**: True conditional probabilities P(next_word | current_word) from our bigram model
# - **Unknown**: What these conditional probabilities would be if estimated from limited data
# - **Method**: Generate samples from the known conditional distribution and use them to estimate the conditional probabilities
#
# This demonstrates the fundamental sampling principle:
# $$P(y|x) = \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{\text{count}(x, y)}{\text{count}(x)}$$
#
# **Why is this useful?** In real-world scenarios, we often need to estimate conditional probabilities from limited data. This shows how estimation accuracy improves with more samples and helps us understand the convergence behavior.

# - **z** = everything else in between (the latent variable we marginalize over)

# ## 6. Temperature Sampling and Biased Estimates
#
# When we don't sample from the true distribution, we get biased estimates. Temperature sampling modifies probabilities: $$P_T(x) = \frac{\exp(\log P(x) / T)}{\sum_i \exp(\log P(i) / T)}$$
#
# Let's demonstrate this by comparing bigram probability convergence at temperature T=1.0 (unbiased) vs T=0.5 (biased).
